Q.1 Develop a Python program to manage a shopping list. Use a list to store items that need to
be purchased. Implement functions to add an item to the list, remove an item by its name, search
for an item to see if it's on the list, and display the current shopping list.
Functions to Implement:
 add_item(item: str): Add a new item to the shopping list.
 remove_item(item: str): Remove an item from the list by its name.
 search_item(item: str) -> bool: Check if an item is on the list and return True if it is,
otherwise False.
 display_list(): Display the current shopping list.
